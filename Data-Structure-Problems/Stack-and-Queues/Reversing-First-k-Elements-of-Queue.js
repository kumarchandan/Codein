 * Reverse the first "k" elements in a given queue

 * Input: A queue and an integer k such that 0 ≤ k ≤ size of the queue
 */

/**
 * Steps:
 * Dequeue k elements from the queue and push them to a Stack
 * Pop the stack one by one and enqueue them
 * Now dequeue (queueSize - k) elments and enqueue them at the same time
 */

/**
 * Runtime Complexity: O(n)
 * Overall, kk elements are dequeued, pushed to the stack, popped from it, and then enqueued.
 * Additionally, n−k elements are dequeued and enqueued to the queue. On the assumption that 
 * each push, pop, enqueue or dequeue operation takes constant time, the time complexity of this 
 * function is O(n) as all nn elements have to be processed with constant-time​ operations.
 * Memory Complexity:
