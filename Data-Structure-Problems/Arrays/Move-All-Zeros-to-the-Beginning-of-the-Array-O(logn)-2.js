/**
 * Given an integer array, move all elements that are 0 to the left while maintaining the order

 * Input: [1,10,-1,11,5,0,-7,0,25,-35]
 * Output: [0,0,1,10,-1,11,5,-7,25,-35]
 * 
 * Note: We need to maintain the order of non-zero elements.

/**
 * Variables:
 *  readIndex: traverses the entire array and stops at non-zero element to be written at writeIndex
 *  writeIndex: Stops where 0 is found
 * 
 * Steps:
 *  Traverse the array from back with readIndex and writeIndex until both of them reaches -1
 *   If readIndex finds 0, skip
 *   If readIndex finds non-0, Update it's value at writeIndex, decrement writeIndex
 *   decrement readIndex
 *   When readIndex reaches -1, write rest of the blocks with 0 until writeIndex also reaches 0
