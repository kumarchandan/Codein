/**
 * Given two strings ‘s1’ and ‘s2’, find the length of the longest substring which is common in both the strings.

 * Input: s1 = "passport"

 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The longest common substring is "ssp".

/**
 * Bottom-up Dynamic Programming
 * Since we want to match all the substrings of the given two strings, we can use a two-dimensional array 
 * to store our results. The lengths of the two strings will define the size of the two dimensions of the array. 
 * So for every index ‘i’ in string ‘s1’ and ‘j’ in string ‘s2’, we have two options:
 * If the character at s1[i] matches s2[j], the length of the common substring would be one plus the length 
 * of the common substring till i-1 and j-1 indexes in the two strings.
 * If the character at the s1[i] does not match s2[j], we don’t have any common substring.
