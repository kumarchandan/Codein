/**
 * Find Combinations for Game Scoring
 * 
 * Imagine a game where a player can score 1,2, or 4 runs.
 * Given a score, n, find the total number of ways to score n runs.
 * 
 * For example, to score 3 runs, a player can score in the following 3 ways:
 * (1 1 1)
 * (1 2)
 * (2 1)
 * 
 * To score 5 runs, a player can score the following 10 ways:
 * (1 1 1 1 1)
 * .
 * .
 * (4 1)

/**
 * Memoization:
 * An optimization technique used to make programs faster and improve 
 * their performance by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning 
 * the cached result when the same input occurs again. It saves the computed results
